# C Project Details
i. The WHY, WHAT, and HOW
The WHY (Challenge addressed):
NASA’s image archives (JWST, Hubble, planetary mosaics) contain incredible scientific value, but they remain underutilized due to their massive size and accessibility issues. Our goal is to democratize access to these images so discoveries are no longer limited to specialists.


# The WHAT (Our solution):
Cosmo Zoom — a web-scale deep-zoom viewer with AI integration. It allows seamless navigation of gigapixel images, live coordinate mapping, pixel-level clarity, and anomaly detection.

ii. Community Involvement
Hope to Achieve: Inspire global learners, enable citizen science contributions, and foster curiosity in space exploration.
Important Note: Our platform emphasizes accessibility — from professional scientists to students in classrooms, anyone can explore NASA’s data.

# Highlighted Features:
AI Analysis – detect exoplanets, galaxies, disks, and hidden phenomena.
Annotation & Photometry – label objects and measure brightness.
Measurement Tools – calculate distances and wavelengths
Image Access – upload JPG, PNG, FITS, or explore NASA datasets.
Results Panel – see object type, description, size, and confidence.

# Benefits:
For scientists: accelerate research and anomaly detection.
For educators: bring space science directly into classrooms.
For enthusiasts: connect the public to NASA’s work in an interactive way.
